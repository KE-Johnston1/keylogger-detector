#  Keylogger Detection Toolkit

A modular, scenario-driven toolkit for detecting keylogger activity across multiple system layers. Built for clarity, transparency, and recruiter-readiness.

---

##  Quick Start

Clone the repo and run any module from the terminal:

```bash
python process_monitor.py
python startup_check.py
python network_monitor.py
python keystroke_scanner.py
python report_builder.py

Each module scans a specific log file and saves results to logs/.
Modules Overview
Module	Purpose	Output File
process_monitor.py	Flags suspicious running processes	logs/output.log
startup_check.py	Detects auto-run programs with keylogger traits	logs/startup_output.log
network_monitor.py	Scans outbound connections to suspicious IPs	logs/network_output.log
keystroke_scanner.py	Parses keystroke logs for stealthy behavior	logs/keystroke_output.log
report_builder.py	Combines all results into one summary	logs/final_report.log

Scenario
You suspect a keylogger is active on your system. This toolkit helps you investigate across process activity, startup entries, outbound connections, and keystroke behaviorâ€”then summarizes findings in one report.

Sample Logs
Each module uses a mock .log file stored in logs/. These simulate real-world data and are easy to swap out for live logs.
